title: My first blog post!

Ok, not really as I tried google blogger before, but didn'y like it much. This is however my first blog post using Jekyll - a static site generator.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
