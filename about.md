I build complex, data-driven websites and applications. 

I have over 15 years of experience building software in various languages. My current tools of choice are [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) web framework with a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). 

I have also used a variety of tools and laguages over those 15 years. Perl, Python, Java, MySQL, Postgres, Visual Basic, Elasticsearch, Linux, Bash, Ansible,  HTML, Javascript, CSS.... 

In my Spare time I like to throw myself down fast flowing rivers in a piece of plastic.
